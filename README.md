Nice to meet you! I'm just a French guy who likes to develop anything and everything ( often anything ). My favorite language is Javascript ( and by extension Node.js ). I can handle C and C++, but I'm just starting. I also know <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, CSS & PHP.

I am currently working on a small Discord bot, [Luna](https://github.com/Asgarrrr/Luna), used by 49012 members.

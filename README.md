Nice to meet you! I'm just a French guy who likes to develop anything and everything ( often anything ). <br/>My favorite language is Javascript ( and by extension Node.js ). I can handle C and C++, but I'm just starting. I also know HTML, CSS & PHP.<br/><br/>
I am currently working on a small Discord bot, [Luna](https://github.com/Asgarrrr/Luna), used by 46592 members.<br/>
##### My work this week<br/>
